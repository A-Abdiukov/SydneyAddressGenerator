# sydney-personal-details-generator
### Generate thousands of personal details with 1 click!

This app can create a large amount of randomly generated personal details, including: address, full name, phone number, date of birth, gender, and email.

The application outputs generated details into a csv file that can be opened in Excel or any text editor.

This could be pretty useful for filling your database with dummy data that looks real; If you need to do that, please see:
